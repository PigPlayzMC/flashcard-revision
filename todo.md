# Todo list #

1. Reading flashcards and adding to correct tier of experience when loading ✅
2. Updating flashcard info [correct/incorrect] ✅
3. Recategorising flashcards based on their correct/incorrect status ✅
    - Store primary keys instead of indexes (Probably more reliable) ✅
4. Update to_practice to be i32 throughout ✅
5. Start using get_user_input rather than two individual lines per input obtaining ✅
6. Fix revision summary ✅

7. Only one db with several tables!!! ✅
8. Support multiple subjects (Creating new tables) ✅/2
    - Allow creation of new sets and selection
9. Support revision of learning, and strong flashcards ✅
10. Allow for correct to be incremented regardless of which set is being revised (ATM this means that revising strong flashcards has no statistical effect) ✅
11. Optomise random index selection (Vec of can choose which is removed from!)
12. Fix issue with autorecognition of flashcard inputs (Not trimming user inputs) ✅
13. Fix wierdness with displaying card movements in revision summary ✅
14. Proper randomisation of flashcards (Seems to be selecting same each time?) {Actually doesn't seem to be an issue!} ✅
15. Fix accuracy for cards (Think it goes off of the struct rather than the db) ✅
16. Edit flashcard function ✅
